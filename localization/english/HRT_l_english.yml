 HRT.0001.t: "Holy Roman Triumph"
 HRT.0001.desc: "In the latter half of the 9th century, Western Europe finds itself in a period of significant transition and fragmentation. The once mighty Carolingian Empire, established by Charlemagne, has been divided, and its unity is a relic of the past.\n\nYou reign as the King of Italy and are crowned #V Imperator Augustus#! of the Carolingian Empire, a title that bestows upon you the grandeur and responsibilities once held by the rulers of ancient Rome. The scope of your [HRT_imperial_authority|E], however, is primarily confined to Italy, with only nominal control extending beyond the borders of your demense. The fragmentation of the Carolingian Empire following the death of Charlemange and the divisions among his heirs has led to political and military challenges, as the once-unified empire crumbles into competing factions, further complicating your ability to exert widespread imperial control.\n\nYou face the daunting task of asserting your authority. Your efforts to strengthen imperial control will be met with resistance and the ever-present challenge of balancing the ambitions of local rulers with the broader goals of the Empire.\n\nThe Carolingian Empire stands at a crossroads, its future uncertain as it navigates the tides of change and the shifting allegiances of its constituent territories."
 HRT.0001.a: "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's."
 
 HRT.0002.desc: "You are #V Romanorum Imperator Augustus#! of the the Holy Roman Empire. Your reign is defined by the need to consolidate [HRT_imperial_authority|E] amidst a complex web of feudal relations. Your control over the Empire's vast territories is challenged by assertive dukes and princes, each wielding considerable power in their own right.\nThe [HRT_investiture_controversy|E] looms large over your reign, pitting the ambitions of the Papacy against the prerogatives of your Imperial Crown.\n\nYour ability to maneuver through these tumultuous times will determine whether the Holy Roman Empire emerges strengthened or falls prey to the forces of division and external pressures."
 
 HRT.0003.t: "The Dissolution of the Empire"
 HRT.0003.desc: "As I stand in my private chambers, gazing out over the sprawling expanse of the Roman Empire, a sense of profound weight settles upon my shoulders. The Roman Empire, revived by Charlemange and a symbol of unity under the Imperial Crown, now faces unprecedented challenges. Fragmentation, the rise of powerful principalities, and the shifting sands of politics have eroded the foundations of this once-great realm.\n\nThe incessant conflicts with the Papacy and the relentless struggle for control within the Empire have led me to a monumental decision.\n\nIn my heart, I know the time has come for a drastic change — a decision that will alter the course of history. The dissolution of the Roman Empire, as radical as it may seem, appears to be the only path forward. This act is not one of defeat but of pragmatism; the need for a new political order."
 HRT.0003.a: "Let this be a new beginning..."
 HRT.0003.a.tt.a: "You dismantle the Roman Empire"
 HRT.0003.a.tt.b: "[de_jure|E] [rulers|E] in the Roman Empire will lose #N 25#! opinion of you for #V 10#! years"
 HRT.0003.b: "No, the Empire shall not fall by my hand."
 
 HRT.0004.t: "The End of an Era"
 HRT.0004.desc: "A messenger arrives in your court with a sealed scroll bearing the imperial seal. As you break the wax and unfurl the parchment, the words written in a meticulous hand convey a message that shakes the very foundations of your realm. Emperor [emperor.GetFirstName] has declared the dissolution of the Roman Empire.\n\nThis news is met with a mixture of disbelief and realization. The Roman Empire, the heart of Christendom and a symbol of unified authority, is to be no more. The Emperor speaks of the insurmountable challenges - the fragmentation of power, and the continuous strife with the Papacy.\n\nThe decision, unprecedented in its scope, marks the end of an era. The Roman Empire that stood as a testament to the legacy of Charlemagne is to be dismantled. This act, radical in every sense, signifies a turning point in the history of our lands."

 HRT.0005.desc: "Your rule as the Roman Emperor, once unassailable, has come to an abrupt end. The established order, fed up with discontent and rival ambitions, has been upended, leaving you bereft of your title, authority and ultimately, the imperial throne itself.\n\nNow, as you ponder your next steps, you are faced with the stark reality of a future without the crown. The legacy of your reign is left to the judgment of history. The loss of the throne is not merely a personal defeat but a pivotal moment in the annals of the Empire, signaling a shift in the balance of power and the fragile nature of imperial authority.\n\nIn the solitude of your diminished station, you reflect on the lessons of power, the vicissitudes of fortune, and the inexorable march of time that spares no ruler, however mighty. The future is uncertain, and the path ahead is uncharted, but the story of your life and reign is far from over."

 HRT_nibelungen.0001.t: "A Legend Retold"
 HRT_nibelungen.0001.desc: "Within the hallowed halls of my grand palace, the court poet stands before me, ready to recount the epic saga of the #V Nibelungenlied#!. With a clear voice that carries the weight of history, [poet.GetFirstName] begins the tale:\n\nIn times of yore, a knight of unparalleled valor emerged from the mists of legend. #V Siegfried#!, son of King Siegmund, came to Worms, drawn by tales of the Burgundian court's splendor. His deeds, bold and mighty, soon became the court's fervent whispers. Among them, his victory over the fearsome dragon and the claim to the Nibelungs' treasure, a hoard unmeasured, which he bathed in, gaining skin impenetrable, save for one untouched spot. The King, intrigued by such tales, welcomed this paragon to his realm."
 HRT_nibelungen.0001.a: "Such commendable bravery!"
 HRT_nibelungen.0001.b: "Unchecked ambition can lead to unforeseen consequences."
 HRT_nibelungen.0001.tt: "The tale continues"
 
 HRT_nibelungen.0002.t: "The Deed for a Queen"
 HRT_nibelungen.0002.desc: "In the heart of the Empire, Siegfried's gaze fell upon fair #V Kriemhild#!, the flower of Burgundy. Her beauty unmatched, her virtue steadfast. Enraptured, Siegfried vowed to win her heart. But the path to love is fraught with trials; only through valor and unwavering spirit could he hope to claim her hand.\n\nYet, love's path led to unexpected roads. #V Gunther#!, King of Burgundy, sought the hand of #V Brunhild#!, a queen of formidable might, whose heart could only be won through trials of strength. Siegfried, in loyalty to Gunther and in quest for his own love, donned the Tarnkappe, a cloak of invisibility and strength, and aided Gunther in this impossible feat. Brunhild, deceived, became Gunther's bride, but the seeds of betrayal were sown."
 HRT_nibelungen.0002.a: "Deception is a path I avoid."
 HRT_nibelungen.0002.b: "The pursuit of power often requires cunning."
 
 HRT_nibelungen.0003.t: "Betrayal and Tragedy"
 HRT_nibelungen.0003.desc: "As whispers of deceit spread, Brunhild's heart grew heavy with doubt and scorn. The bond of kings and knights, once unbreakable, now trembled under the weight of hidden truths. #V Hagen#!, Gunther's vassal, driven by loyalty and dark designs, plotted Siegfried's fall. In a grim hunt, betrayal struck; Siegfried fell, not by beast or enemy, but by the hand of kinship turned cold.\n\nMourning turned to fury as Kriemhild's heart cried out for justice. The gleaming halls of Worms grew dim with the shadow of revenge. Kriemhild, in her sorrow, found new purpose. With the Nibelungen treasure, she sought allies, wielding gold and grief as her weapons. A storm brewed over the realm, as Kriemhild's resolve hardened; the quest for vengeance would shake the very foundations of the Empire."

A great feast turned to slaughter, and the rivers ran red with the blood of the fallen. Yet, in her triumph, Kriemhild found no peace, only more bloodshed.\n\nAnd so, the tale of the Nibelungenlied reaches us, not just as a story of heroes and villains, but as a reflection on the human condition. It is said the Nibelungen treasure, cause of so much strife, lies hidden in the depths of the Rhine, awaiting one worthy to claim it."

 HRT_nibelungen.0024.desc: "As the sun dips below the horizon, casting a golden glow upon the vineyard-cloaked hills that flank the majestic Rhine, our search for the fabled Nibelungen treasure reached its climax. Hidden from the prying eyes of the world, we uncovered a relic of untold power and significance: the Valkyr Helmet, worn by the legendary warrior queen Brünhilde herself.\n\nAs the helmet gleamed in the fading light, its ancient runes and intricate engravings whispered tales of valor and sacrifice, echoing the triumphs and tragedies of the Nibelungen saga. With each passing moment, the lessons learned on our journey paralleled those of the heroes of old: the bonds of loyalty tested, the fires of ambition kindled, and the price of hubris paid in blood.\n\nYet, amidst the echoes of the past, a new chapter unfolds. For in the discovery of the Valkyr Helmet, we found not only a relic of historical significance but a symbol of unity and strength for the Holy Roman Empire. As we gaze upon the helm, we are reminded that true greatness lies not in the wealth of kingdoms or the spoils of conquest, but in the courage to face adversity and the wisdom to learn from the lessons of history.\n\nWith the Valkyr Helmet in our possession, we embark on the journey back to the heart of the empire, our spirits buoyed by the knowledge that we had uncovered a treasure that would forever shape the course of history. And as we cross the threshold into a new era, we carry with us the lessons learned on our quest: the power of perseverance, the importance of loyalty, and the enduring legacy of the Nibelungen saga."

Undeterred by this setback, we resolved to redouble our efforts, knowing that the path to the Nibelungen treasure would be fraught with challenges and false promises."
